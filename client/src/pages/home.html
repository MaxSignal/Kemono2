        <b>June 13, 2021 -</b> It's been a stressful few days, but we've managed to more or less fix the performance issues with small tweaks to how the site works. Additionally, multiple reliability improvements have been made to the importer.

Regardless, I will try my best to get the board back up and running as soon as possible.<br>
